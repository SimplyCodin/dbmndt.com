        <p>
            Traditional music services and tools only work in one direction, from artists to fans.<br>
            We flip this idea on its head by giving the fans the same tools artist use share and promote artists and their music.<br>
	        By giving fans the same tools as artists reduces the burden of promotion and increases fan engagement.<br>
	        Because artists know their fans best, we give them fan analytics and customization tools
